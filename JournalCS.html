<p> Journal entry #1: April 6, 2020
</p>

<p> This is my first journal entry. I started my website today. I made three different web pages: the home page, the projects tab, and the journal tab. I had previously coded Flappy Bird over the past couple of weeks, which I linked to the projects page of the site. Will start work on another project soon
</p>

<p> Journal entry #2: April 7, 2020
</p>

<p> This is my first second entry. Today, I somewhat debugged flappy bird and moved the canvas on the page to the center. I also changed the background image of the site, and changed the text color and font. Next time I will expand on the css of the site and (hopefully) start work on a new project.
</p>

<p> Journal entry #3: April 11, 2020
</p>

<p> This is my first third entry. Today, I added a new project to my site. It's a variation of the game brickbreaker. I'm going to update the CSS quite a bit next journal entry so that the website looks moderately aesthetically pleasing.
